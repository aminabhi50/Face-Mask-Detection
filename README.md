# Face Mask Detection

* Developed a deep learning model which uses the pretrained ResNet50 model with FaceNet model to detect the medical face mask in real time video and image.
* Used OpenCV library to preprocess the images having medical face mask.
* Real time detection of medical mask in image is shown in realtime.png.
* **Technology Used:** Python, Google Colab, Scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas, Keras, Tensorflow, Matplotlib, OpenCV, DCNN models.
